LCS (longest common subsequence) algorithm is based on the following [paper](http://www.iaeng.org/publication/WCE2010/WCE2010_pp499-504.pdf).

LCS-LIS is longest common subsequence algorithm based on LIS(longest increasing subsequence), which is presented [here](http://cppalgo.blogspot.ru/2011/03/lcs-lis.html)

LUP is LUP-decompostion algorithm.

All parallel algorithms are done using MPI library.
